# Using Natural Language Processing for Tagalog Fake News Detection
The purpose of this study is to train and apply a machine learning model for the detection of fake Filipino news articles on the internet. This study also aims to test accuracy of the trained machine learning model in differentiating real and fake news.

---


**Objectives:**
1.	To test the classification modelâ€™s performance in terms of: 

  a.	accuracy, 

  b.	recall, and 

  c.	f1 score.
2.	To determine the words that have a high frequency of occurring on Filipino
fake news and real news.
3.	To determine the viability of the machine learning model for and development. (Accuracy > 90%)

**Research Questions**

Is there a significant difference between the classification model's predictions and actual (test) values?

*Sub-questions:*
1.	Is there a significant difference in the accuracy metrics for the train and test dataset? 
2.	How does the classification model perform in terms of accuracy, recall, accuracy, and f1 score? 
3.	Which words have the highest frequencies in fake Filipino news?
4.	Which words have the highest frequencies in occurring sarcastic headlines?


**Multinomial Naive Bayes Approach**
